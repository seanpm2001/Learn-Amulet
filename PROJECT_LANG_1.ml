(* Project language file 1
* For: seanpm2001/Learn-Amulet
* About:
* I decided to make Amulet the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Amulet) as Amulet is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Amulet programming language. It only makes sense to Amulet the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
